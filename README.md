# LegoSetInventoryManager

This application was supposed to allow a user to allow the user to add, update, and search lego sets in a data base.  Unfortuntley i'm working on a mac and have had serious problems connecting my sql server data base.  I get this error "A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 35 - An internal exception was caught)"  I have tried many google searches to fix the problem and have been unable to do so.  

So in short my project is partialy completed, which ever mentor reviews it I hope that you may show mercy and extend me a life line with help and the opprotunity to finish this weekend. 

Thanks, 

Mike
