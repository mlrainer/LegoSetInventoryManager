# LegoSetInventoryManager

This application was supposed to allow a user to  to add, update, and search lego sets in a data base.  Unfortuntley i'm working on a mac and have had serious problems connecting my sql server data base.  I get this error "A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 35 - An internal exception was caught)"  I have tried many google searches to fix the problem and have been unable to do so.  

Update: My class mate Michael Sheperd did his best to help me with setting up postgres but i'm still having some issues.  Hoping I can do web dev and take this class again later.  

So in short my project is partialy completed I spent a bunch of time trying to get a data base running on a mac to make this project work. 

Thanks, 

Mike
